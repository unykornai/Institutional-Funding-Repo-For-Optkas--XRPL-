# Track C — Tokenized Credit (Reserved)

**Risk Rating:** 🟡 Medium–High  
**Status:** Reserved — Legal-First, Code-Second  
**Activation:** Via Activation Decision Memo + External Counsel Clearance

---

## Purpose

Track C covers private tokenized credit instruments — tokens that represent participation in a credit facility, a note claim, or a structured obligation. This is **advanced territory** that often triggers securities law.

## Why It's Reserved

- Token rights must be precisely defined before any code is written
- Transfer restrictions, disclosures, and redemption mechanics require legal structuring
- Jurisdiction and exemption analysis is mandatory
- This is a legal project first, a technology project second

## Minimum Requirements Before Activation

1. External counsel engaged for securities analysis
2. Token rights and restrictions defined (what does the token represent?)
3. Transfer restriction mechanics documented
4. Investor disclosure drafted
5. Jurisdiction + exemption analysis complete (144A, Reg D, Reg S, etc.)
6. Redemption mechanics specified

## Folder Structure (When Activated)
