## Standard Non-Reliance Language

The following language must be included in all counterparty-facing materials associated with this XRPL parallel execution framework:

---

### For Institutional Lenders (Track A / B)

> **NON-RELIANCE STATEMENT**
>
> The XRPL-based systems described herein are provided for transparency, internal controls, and optional settlement purposes only. No lender, counterparty, custodian, or agent is required to rely upon, interface with, or accept any XRPL-based system as a condition of the facility.
>
> Collateral validity, security interest perfection, and enforcement rights are established exclusively through traditional legal instruments (UCC filings, security agreements, control agreements, and applicable state and federal law) and do not depend on any blockchain, distributed ledger, or digital asset infrastructure.
>
> The Borrower maintains traditional banking rails as the primary and fallback settlement mechanism for all facility-related payments. On-chain settlement is available only where explicitly agreed by all parties in writing.

---

### For Private / Strategic Counterparties (Track B / C)

> **SETTLEMENT RAIL DISCLOSURE**
>
> This facility may utilize stablecoin-based settlement (USDC, USDT, or equivalent) as an alternative funding and repayment rail. Use of on-chain settlement does not modify the legal terms of the facility, the security interest, or the enforcement rights of any party.
>
> All on-chain transactions are supplemented by traditional legal documentation and banking fallback rails. No party is required to accept on-chain settlement as the sole method of funding or repayment.

---

### For Track D (If Activated — Issuer Disclaimer)

> **ISSUER DISCLAIMER**
>
> Any digital asset or IOU token issued under Track D of this framework is issued by [Issuer Entity Name], not by the Borrower SPV, and is a separate instrument from any credit facility, loan, or security interest.
>
> Holders of issued tokens should rely solely on the issuer's offering documentation, reserve attestation, and redemption terms. No credit facility lender has any obligation or exposure to issued tokens.
