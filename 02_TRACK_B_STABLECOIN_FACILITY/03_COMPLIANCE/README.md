# Track B — Compliance

This folder contains KYB/KYC, sanctions, and source-of-funds documentation for stablecoin facility counterparties.

## Required Documents (per counterparty)

| Document | Status |
|:---------|:-------|
| KYB/KYC Package (Borrower + UBOs) | Available from institutional package |
| Sanctions / OFAC Certification | Available from institutional package |
| Source of Funds Statement | Available from institutional package |
| Wallet Verification (chain-specific) | 🔲 Prepare upon activation |
| Travel Rule Compliance Memo | 🔲 Prepare if transaction thresholds apply |

## Note
Most compliance documents can be reused from the institutional funding package (`Institutional-Funding-Repo-For-Optkas-`). Chain-specific compliance (wallet verification, travel rule) is additive.
