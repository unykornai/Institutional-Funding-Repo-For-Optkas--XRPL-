# Post-Close XRPL Enhancement Addendum

**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** February 9, 2026 | **Owner:** OPTKAS1 LLC  
**Purpose:** Template addendum language that a Lender may accept as part of or following a Facility Agreement, positioning XRPL-based reporting and reconciliation as a post-closing enhancement — not a dependency or condition of the facility.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

This document is a **template only**. It must be reviewed and approved by both Borrower's and Lender's counsel before execution. No party should rely on this template as legal advice.

This addendum is designed to be **appended to an existing Facility Agreement** after closing. It does not modify the core facility terms, security structure, or settlement mechanics. It adds an optional reporting and transparency layer.

## ADDENDUM TO FACILITY AGREEMENT

### REPORTING AND RECONCILIATION ENHANCEMENT — DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY

**This Addendum** (the "Addendum") is entered into as of [DATE], by and between:

**Borrower:** OPTKAS1 LLC, a Wyoming Series Limited Liability Company  
**Lender:** [LENDER NAME]  

**In connection with** the Facility Agreement dated [FACILITY AGREEMENT DATE] (the "Agreement").

**WHEREAS**, the Borrower and Lender have entered into the Agreement on the terms set forth therein;

**WHEREAS**, the Borrower desires to implement an enhanced reporting and reconciliation system utilizing distributed ledger technology (specifically, the XRP Ledger) to provide the Lender with additional transparency into collateral management, facility transactions, and covenant compliance;

**WHEREAS**, the Lender acknowledges that such enhancement is voluntary, supplemental to the reporting obligations already set forth in the Agreement, and does not constitute a condition precedent, covenant, or dependency of the Agreement;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, the parties agree as follows:

---

### SECTION 1: DEFINITIONS

For the purposes of this Addendum:

**"DLT System"** means the Borrower's internal reporting and reconciliation system that utilizes the XRP Ledger to create an immutable record of certain facility-related data.

**"DLT Reports"** means reports generated by the DLT System and made available to the Lender as a supplement to the reports required under the Agreement.

**"Standard Reports"** means all reports, certificates, and statements required under the Agreement as originally executed, delivered through the channels specified therein.

---

### SECTION 2: SCOPE OF ENHANCEMENT

2.1 **Supplemental Reporting Only.** The DLT System provides supplemental reporting to the Lender. DLT Reports are provided in addition to, and not in replacement of, Standard Reports.

2.2 **No Modification of Agreement.** Nothing in this Addendum shall modify, amend, or supersede any term, condition, covenant, representation, warranty, or obligation set forth in the Agreement. In the event of any conflict between this Addendum and the Agreement, the Agreement shall govern.

2.3 **No Dependency.** The operation, availability, accuracy, or continuity of the DLT System is not a condition precedent to any draw, repayment, covenant compliance determination, or any other obligation under the Agreement. The failure or discontinuation of the DLT System shall have no effect on the validity, enforceability, or terms of the Agreement.

---

### SECTION 3: DLT SYSTEM CAPABILITIES

3.1 **Available Data.** Subject to the Borrower's operational capabilities and the Lender's consent, the DLT System may provide the following supplemental data:

| Data Type | Description | Frequency |
|:----------|:-----------|:----------|
| Collateral Hash | Cryptographic proof of collateral schedule | Daily |
| Transaction Record | Immutable log of facility draws and repayments | Per transaction |
| Coverage Snapshot | Point-in-time collateral coverage calculation | Daily |
| Covenant Status | Summary of covenant compliance indicators | Weekly |
| Audit Trail | Sequential record of all facility-related events | Continuous |

3.2 **Access.** The Lender may access DLT Reports through a secure portal or API provided by the Borrower. Access credentials will be provided upon request.

3.3 **Format.** DLT Reports will be provided in human-readable format (PDF or web dashboard) in addition to any machine-readable format. The Lender is not required to interact with the underlying distributed ledger directly.

---

### SECTION 4: NON-RELIANCE

4.1 **No Reliance on DLT Reports.** The Lender acknowledges and agrees that it shall not rely upon DLT Reports for any purpose including, without limitation:

   (a) Determining whether a draw request should be funded;  
   (b) Assessing covenant compliance;  
   (c) Calculating collateral coverage ratios;  
   (d) Making any credit decision;  
   (e) Evaluating the financial condition of the Borrower or the Issuer.

4.2 **Standard Reports Control.** All determinations regarding the Borrower's compliance with the Agreement shall be made solely on the basis of Standard Reports delivered in accordance with the Agreement.

4.3 **No Representation or Warranty.** The Borrower makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the DLT System or DLT Reports. The DLT System is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.

4.4 **No Duty to Monitor.** The Lender shall have no duty or obligation to monitor, review, or verify DLT Reports. The availability of DLT Reports shall not create any inference that the Lender has reviewed such reports or is aware of information contained therein.

---

### SECTION 5: DISCONTINUATION

5.1 **Borrower Right to Discontinue.** The Borrower may discontinue the DLT System at any time, for any reason or no reason, upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the Lender. Such discontinuation shall not constitute an Event of Default or a breach of any obligation under the Agreement.

5.2 **Lender Right to Opt Out.** The Lender may elect to stop receiving DLT Reports at any time by written notice to the Borrower. Such election shall not affect any other rights or obligations under the Agreement.

5.3 **Automatic Discontinuation.** The DLT System shall automatically be discontinued if:

   (a) The Agreement is terminated for any reason;  
   (b) All amounts outstanding under the Agreement are repaid in full;  
   (c) The Borrower determines, in its sole discretion, that the DLT System is no longer operationally viable.

---

### SECTION 6: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND CONFIDENTIALITY

6.1 **Borrower IP.** The DLT System, including all software, algorithms, and processes, is the intellectual property of the Borrower and/or its technology partners. Nothing in this Addendum grants the Lender any rights to such intellectual property.

6.2 **Confidentiality.** DLT Reports and any data accessed through the DLT System are Confidential Information as defined in the Agreement and subject to the confidentiality provisions thereof.

---

### SECTION 7: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

7.1 **No Liability.** The Borrower shall not be liable to the Lender for any loss, damage, claim, or expense arising from or related to:

   (a) Any error, omission, delay, or inaccuracy in DLT Reports;  
   (b) Any interruption, failure, or discontinuation of the DLT System;  
   (c) Any action or inaction taken by the Lender based on DLT Reports;  
   (d) Any unauthorized access to or use of the DLT System.

7.2 **Indemnification.** The Lender shall indemnify the Borrower against any claim arising from the Lender's use of or reliance on DLT Reports in a manner inconsistent with Section 4 of this Addendum.

---

### SECTION 8: GENERAL PROVISIONS

## USAGE GUIDANCE (INTERNAL — DO NOT INCLUDE IN EXECUTED VERSION)

### When to Propose This Addendum

| Scenario | When to Introduce | How to Position |
|:---------|:-----------------|:----------------|
| Lender asks about blockchain/XRPL | During term negotiation | "We have an optional transparency layer we can activate post-close" |
| Lender is technology-forward | After closing, as value-add | "We've built a supplemental reporting tool. Would you like access?" |
| Lender has compliance concerns about crypto | **DO NOT INTRODUCE** | Keep the facility 100% traditional; add XRPL internally only (Track A) |
| Lender specifically requests DLT reporting | During documentation | Include this Addendum as an exhibit to the Facility Agreement |

### Key Selling Points for Lenders

1. **"This doesn't change anything about the facility."** — Section 2.2 and 2.3 make this explicit.
2. **"You're not required to use it."** — Section 5.2 lets them opt out anytime.
3. **"Your standard reports still control."** — Section 4.2 is unambiguous.
4. **"No additional risk to you."** — Sections 4 and 7 provide full insulation.
5. **"It's just better data, faster."** — The DLT System provides real-time visibility that traditional reporting cannot match.

### Prohibited Actions

- ❌ Never send this Addendum unsolicited to a lender who hasn't asked about technology
- ❌ Never position XRPL as a requirement or dependency
- ❌ Never suggest the facility "requires" or "depends on" distributed ledger technology
- ❌ Never use the words "crypto," "token," "decentralized," or "Web3" in any version sent to lenders
- ❌ Never include this Addendum in initial data room packages — introduce only when appropriate

### Language Substitution Guide

When discussing the DLT System with lenders, use the following language:

| Instead of... | Say... |
|:-------------|:-------|
| Blockchain | Distributed ledger technology |
| XRPL | Our reconciliation platform |
| Crypto | Digital settlement infrastructure |
| Smart contract | Automated compliance logic |
| Token | Digital record |
| On-chain | In the reporting system |
| Wallet | Designated account |
| DeFi | (Never use this word) |
